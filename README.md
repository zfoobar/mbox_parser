## Embedding Python Interpreter and Dependencies into Platypus-Built App

With some manual effort, it is possible to package this script as a drag-and-drop Platypus-built Mac app. In order to do this, we are required to bundle a python installation (interpreter and dependencies) within the app's resources. This is possible by following the guide below.

- [Adding Embedded Python Interpreter](http://joaoventura.net/blog/2016/embeddable-python-osx/)

Once you are done with this guide, then you need to remove the `python3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages` symlink and replace it with the `site-packages` that have been installed in your virtual environment as you were developing.
